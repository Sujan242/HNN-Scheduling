# HNN-Scheduling

In this research, the problem of scheduling a single burn-in oven, a batch processing machine (BPM), with non-identical job sizes as well as non-agreeable release time and due date is considered. The objective is to minimize the total weighted tardiness of the jobs. Due to the computational intractability of the problem in obtaining exact solution, a few variants of neural network (NN) based approaches are proposed. A computational experiment is carried out to understand the efficiency of proposed variants of the NN approaches, over 160 small scale problem instances, with optimal solution obtained using LINGO and to obtain the best one among the proposed variants of NN based approaches. Another computational experiment is carried out to understand the efficiency of the proposed variants of the NN based approaches, over 640 large scale problem instances, with estimated optimal solution (obtained using Weibull Distribution) and to obtain the best proposed variant of NN based approaches considered in the study. Based on both empirical and statistical performance analyses, the proposed variant of NN based approach: FDD-NN outperforms the other proposed variants of NN based approaches on a large scale problem instances considered in this study.
